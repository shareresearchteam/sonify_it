To maintain a reasonable folder structure, we will place our current and future examples in folders named <robot>-<tag>. Roslaunch files for each sound profile set (or robot) should be named the same as these folders. For instance, we have named our folder "turtlebot2-share" ("share" for SHARE Lab).
